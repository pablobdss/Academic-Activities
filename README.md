<h1>College Works</h1>

I'm using a method while writing my Python scripts that combines the "while True" loop with "try except" structures to do checks and validations on user inputs. These processes help to make sure that communications with the programs are more precise and understandable.

For instance, there are times when I require users to provide values that fall within a certain range. For instance, it's crucial that pupils receive marks that range from 0 to 10. To assure accuracy, I use a "if" statement to determine whether the grade is inside this range. If not, the software alerts the user that the grade is wrong and asks them to enter the student's grade again.


To address potential input problems, the "try except" structure must also be used. If a user enters something than a number, such a letter, the software won't crash. Instead, it will keep asking for precise information and stating that only numbers are acceptable.

In conclusion, my aim is to design programs that are more interactive and mistake tolerant, hence improving the user experience.
